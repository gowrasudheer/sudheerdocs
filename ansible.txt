ansible tutorial 

1.ansible is a very powerfull open source automation tool
2.ansible is configuration management tool
3.ansible is agent less tool

what is configuration management ?

1.in simple term configuration means changing of "IT" infrastructures like OS, network devices , applications, softwares and cloud computing services are called as configuration management 

why we need configuration tool ?

1.configuration of IT infrastructure like software & OS changes happens then we have add update for doing the things when we doing such things its very time taking when doing hundread of servers

some imp terminology 

1.client server controller

2.target server

3.inventory file 

4.ansible only uses ssh connections

5.playbook It will contain all the instruction for configuration 

6. ansible.cfg it contains configuration details 

7. when u run any command any command in ansible will read ansible.cfg { path of inventory file }

some configuration management tools 

1. puppet

2. chef

3.saltstack

notes:-

1.where we installed ansible is called CONTROL MACHINE

2.ansible is wriiten in python language

3.we have to install python in controll machine 

some importent terminlogy used in ansible :-
-------------------------------------------

1.INVENTORY FILE

inventory is a text file where u define the host information that you want manage with 

ansible the default inventory file location is /etc/ansible/hosts

2. HOSTS AND GROUPS :-
-----------------------

A host file consists of host groups its contains server IP address 

[webserver]
192.168.1.13
[dbserver]
192.168.1.14

in this above examples webserver and dbserver the given hosts :-
--------------------------------------------------------------
To know how many hosts present in the ansible we have to use following command 

ansible --list-hosts all { it will print all the details about the ansible hosts details }

ansible --list-hosts groupname {it will give the result about particular group details }


Inventory for production system 
-------------------------------

1.ansible uses SSH its always do SSh key exchange and authorized ansible login to nodes 

2.we can manage IP address with /etc/hosts file 


example :-

cat /etc/hosts

192.168.1.13 web1

192.168.1.14 db1

Adhoc command :-
-------------

ansible give a quick method to communicate and execute commands on remote/local machines through Adhoc commands

example:-
--------

ansible -i webserver -m ping 

explanation :-
-----------

1.adhoc commands are executed by specify ansible command 

2. -i < inventory name > its tell ansible to pick up host information ( if u want run particular host group we have to use -i on that )

3. -m < module > ping is a module which will login to the hosts and check the connectivity

Few more examples with adhoc command :--
-------------------------------------



SOLUTION :-
-----------

/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg file and uncomment 

#host_key_checking=False

we have to uncomment the 

host_key_checking=false

Group of Groups and Group variables:-
------------------------------------
variables can be applied an entier group 

[webservers]
web1
[dbserver]
db1

[datacenter:children]
webservers
dataservers

[datacenter:var]
ansible_ssh_user=vagrant
ansible_ssh_pass='vagrant'

[datacenter:children] tells datacenter is a master group and underneath we specify other groupnmes

[datacenter:var] is used to define variable at the group level you can specify variable on any group by specifying [groupname:vars]

GENERAL FOR ALL CONNECTIONS
---------------------------

ansible_host:-

the name of the hosts to connect to,if different from the alias you wish to give to it

ansible_port:-

the ssh port number,if not 22

ansible_user

the default ssh user name to use

ansible_ssh_pass

the ssh password use (never store this variable in plain text always use valut)

ansible_ssh_private_key_file

private key file used by ssh usefull using multiple keys and you dont to use SSH agent 


ABOUT modules:-
--------------

Module ( also reffered as task plugin or library plugin ) 

raw module {raw module is used when in target severs are not installed with python }

example :-

ansible IP -m raw -a 'echo hello' > /root/sample.txt
----------------------------------------------------
some more adhoc commands used in ansible { what is adhoc command ( if un want run immediate action on target servers we have to use adhoc commands )

to check the files in target servers we have to use following this

 ansible all -a " la -ltra /root/any file name "
------------------------------------------------

when we run any command in adhoc we are getting following result will be 

172.17.0.3  |  changed |  rc =0 -- >>

if get this result will sucessful 

( when we get rc = 0 means u r command what we excuted is sucessful )
---------------------------------------------------------------------

( when we get rc = 1 means u r command what we excuted is not sucessful ) to know command will be echo $?

to know targer server machine version and os kernal deatils ips we have to use the following command  { setup }

ansible groupname -m setup ( we are getting all the system related information ) 
---------------------------

-a {{{ action }}}

by using -a command we can find are search particular thing ip adress any thing u want )

ansiible groupname -m setup -a ' fillter=*ipv4 '
------------------------------------------------

If u want get all the information about the server we have to use setup --tree

ansible all -m setup --tree /root/directory name
------------------------------------------------
it will stroe target server details in in file modes in the given directory


if u want use cat are any linux commands we have to use following adhoc command 

ansible all -a "cat /root/sample.txt" :-
ansible all -a "vim /root/sample.txt" :
-------------------------------------

copying file from controller to target server 

in docker if u want copy any file scp sample.txt root@172.17.0.3:/root/

in ansible we have to use 

ansible all -m copy -a "src=sample.txt dest-/root/"

src= source and copy is module  dest=destination

---------------------------------------------------

copying directory 

ansible all -m file -a " path=/root/directname dest=/root state=directory"

file is module path=location dest=destination 

------------------------------------------------------------------

if u want creat file in agent server we have to use

ansible all -m file -a "path=/root/towhich directory we have to creat that name/hello.txt state=touch"

ex :- ansible all -m file -a "path/sudheer/hello.txt state=touch"

------------------------------------------------------------------

state = presant it will install the packages

      = absent it will uninstall the particular pacakge
--------------------------------------------------------------------

to install packages in adhoc we have to use 

ansible all -m apt -a " name=git state=present"

to check installed are not we have to use following command 

ansible all -a " which git "

---------------------------------------------------------------------
to give read write excute permission for target server we have to use

ansible appserver -m file  -a "dest=/root/2 mode=777"

in this mode will used to assign permission to the file

to check permission assined or not we have to use this command
 
ansible appserver -a " la -ltr "

----------------------------------------------------------------------
